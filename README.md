- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. It's important to remember that code is read far more often than it's written, so making it easy for others (and your future self) to understand is crucial. Use meaningful variable names, write clear comments, and break up long functions or methods into smaller, more manageable pieces. And don't forget to test your code thoroughly to catch any bugs or errors early on."
