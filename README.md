- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. It's important to remember that code is read far more often than it's written, so making it easy for others (and your future self) to understand is crucial. Use meaningful variable names, write clear comments, and break up long functions or methods into smaller, more manageable pieces. And don't forget to test your code thoroughly to catch any bugs or errors early on."

- "Programming wisdom for today: Always write code as if the person who will maintain it is a violent psychopath who knows where you live." 

This quote, often attributed to Martin Golding, emphasizes the importance of writing clean, well-structured, and easily understandable code. It's not just about making your own life easier when you have to revisit your code in the future, but also about being considerate of your colleagues or anyone else who may have to work with your code. By following this advice, you can help ensure that your code is maintainable, scalable, and less prone to bugs and errors.
